# Audio Coverage Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Child-Survey File Counting Issue ✅

**Problem**: The web dashboard was showing 0 audio files for child-survey because it was only looking in the standard `audio/{lang}/` directories, not the `child-survey/{lang}/` subdirectories.

**Root Cause**: Child-survey files are organized in language subdirectories:
- `gs://levante-assets-dev/audio/child-survey/es-CO/` (25 files)
- `gs://levante-assets-dev/audio/child-survey/en/` (25 files)
- etc.

**Solution**: Enhanced the audio-coverage.html with:
- `countChildSurveyFiles()` function to properly count across all language subdirectories
- Updated counting logic to include child-survey files in totals

### 2. Missing Audio Details Functionality ✅

**Problem**: Users couldn't see which specific audio files were missing when clicking on missing counts.

**Solution**: Added clickable missing audio cells with:
- `showMissingAudioDetails()` function to display modal with missing file details
- `loadMissingAudioDetails()` function to load and display specific missing items
- Clickable cells that show detailed breakdown of missing files

## Current Status

### Child-Survey Files Deployed ✅
- **Dev**: 149 total files across 6 languages
- **Prod**: 935 total files across 7 languages (includes shared files)
- **es-CO**: 25 files in both environments (as expected)

### Web Dashboard Enhancements ✅
- Missing audio count cells are now clickable
- Clicking shows detailed modal with:
  - Specific missing file IDs
  - Reason for missing (file not found, error reading, voice mismatch)
  - Up to 50 missing items displayed with pagination info
- Child-survey counting function available in console

## Files Modified

1. **`web-dashboard/public/audio-coverage.html`**
   - Added clickable missing audio cells
   - Added `countChildSurveyFiles()` function
   - Added `showMissingAudioDetails()` modal functionality
   - Added `loadMissingAudioDetails()` detailed loading

2. **`test_child_survey_counting.py`** (Created)
   - Test script to verify child-survey file counting
   - Confirms proper deployment across environments

## Usage

### For Child-Survey Counting
```javascript
// In browser console on audio-coverage page
await countChildSurveyFiles('levante-assets-dev')
// Returns: { total: 149, byLanguage: { 'es-CO': 25, 'en': 25, ... } }
```

### For Missing Audio Details
- Click on any missing count cell in the audio coverage table
- Modal will show detailed breakdown of missing files
- Includes file IDs and reasons for missing status

## Verification

✅ **Child-survey files properly deployed**: 25 es-CO files in both dev and prod
✅ **Clickable missing audio cells**: Enhanced user experience for debugging
✅ **Cross-language counting**: Properly counts files across all language subdirectories
✅ **Detailed missing file information**: Users can see exactly which files are missing and why

The audio coverage dashboard now provides comprehensive visibility into both standard audio files and child-survey files, with enhanced debugging capabilities for missing audio detection.
